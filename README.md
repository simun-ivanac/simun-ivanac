# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the place where fun begins.

<br>

## About me

Iâ€™m a software engineer with years of experience in developing web applications. I'm also very simple to understand.

I love:
- solving problems,
- learning new things,
- building practical solutions,
- lists.

<i>I don't love:</i>
- poor written documentation,
- failed CI/CD pipelines.

<br>

My programming is not writing prompts or autocompletion. I learn things as I write code. Why would I leave that up to AI?

My focus is on PHP and building strong backend applications. E-commerce projects make me even happier.
