# Hi there 👋

Here you can find a little bit of information about my background.

<br>

## About me

I’m a software engineer with years of experience in developing web applications.

I love:
- solving problems,
- learning new things,
- building practical solutions.

<i>I don't like:</i>
- poor written documentation,
- failed CI/CD pipelines.

<br>

My focus is on PHP and building strong backend applications. Ecommerce projects make it even better.

I learn things as I write code. That's why I don't use AI very much.
